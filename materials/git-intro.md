# Git

_git_ : is the most common used version control system.

- It allows you to clone repos.
- It tracks your changes you make to files.
- Store your files history, which means you can go to the previous version in
  case you made a mistake.
- It makes collaboration easier allowing changed by different developers to be
  merged into one source.
- It can automatically merge the changes, so two developers can work on the same
  file and later they can merge their works.
